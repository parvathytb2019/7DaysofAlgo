## Code
```

    for i in range(2,n):
        if(n%i==0):
            flag=0
            break
    if(flag==0):

## Explenation
Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves.
The function `is_prime(n)` will check whether the number n is divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and (n-1), 
and if possible the function will print a `False`(which means n is not a prime number) and if not possible the function will print `True`(which means n is a prime number).
